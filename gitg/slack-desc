# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gitg: gitg - git repository viewer targeting gtk+/GNOME
gitg:
gitg: gitg is a git repository viewer targeting gtk+/GNOME. One of its 
gitg: main objectives is to provide a more unified user experience for 
gitg: git frontends across multiple desktops. It does this not be writing 
gitg: a cross-platform application, but by close collaboration with similar 
gitg: clients for other operating systems (like GitX for OS X).
